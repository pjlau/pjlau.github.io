<h3> This dataset was extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database.

It is widely used for predicting whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.

The original dataset can be found in UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult
	
Definition:

Rich: Income > 50k, Poor: Income <=50k
